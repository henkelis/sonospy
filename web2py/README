#1.56
Consider the following table:

db.define_table('cirlce',
   db.Field('radius','double'),
   db.Field('area','double'),
   db.Field('modified_on','datetime'))

now you can do:

# add a comment in the forms
db.circle.area.comment="(this is a comment)"

# do not show area in create/edit forms
db.circle.area.writable=False

 # do not show now in display forms
db.circle.modified_on.readable=False

# automatically timestamp when record cretaed
db.circle.modified_on.default=request.now

# automatically timestamp when record is modified
db.circle.modified_on.update=request.now

# make the radius appear in bold in display and table
db.circle.radius.represent=lambda value: B(value)

# make a form that automatically computes area
pi=3.1415
form=SQLFOM(db.circle)
if form.accepts(request.vars,
onvalidation=lambda form: form.vars.area=pi*form.vars.radius**2): ...

# make a create form in two possible ways:
form=SQLFORM(db.circle)
form=SQLFORM(db.circle,0)

# make an update form in two possible ways:
form=SQLFORM(db.circle,record)
form=SQLFORM(db.circle,record_id)

# make a display form in two possible ways:
form=SQLFORM(db.circle,record,readonly=True)
form=SQLFORM(db.circle,record_id,readonly=True)

# so now you can do...

form=SQLFORM(db.circle,request.args[-1])

and you get a create form if the URL ends in /0, you get an update
form if the URL ends in /[valid_record_id]

#you can also define once for all

timestamp=SQLTable(None,'timestamp',
            SQLField('created_on','datetime',
                          writable=False,
                          default=request.now),
            SQLField('modified_on','datetime',
                          writable=False,
                          default=request.now,update=request.now))

#and use it in all your tables

db.define_table('mytable',db.Field('somefield'),timestamp)
