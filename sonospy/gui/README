SONOSPY GUI READ ME
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need to get wxPython 2.8 in order to run the GUI 
(http://www.wxpython.org/download.php)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In general, everything has a tool tip associated with it for some attempts 
at clarity.

Preferences are stored in gui/GUIpref.ini and can be manually edited or 
can be saved within the app on each specific tab using the SAVE DEFAULTS 
button.

You can run this by ./sonsopyGUI.py (linux) or python sonospyGUI.py 
(linux/windows).  Databases created here are still stored where scan, etc. 
uses them.

[LAUNCH TAB]
 - Will launch and stop Sonospy.
 - AUTO POPULATE will search for databases (extensions can be set in 
   GUIpref.ini) and will autopopulate the databases and proxy names for you.

[SCAN TAB]
 - SCAN and REPAIR both log to the log window, but it comes through 
   chunk at a time.  Not quite in realtime, but close enough.

[EXTRACT TAB]
 - Last <X> Albums is experimental, it gets the job done, but it's not 
   perfect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN ISSUES
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Loading virtuals only works with one "set".  If you store more than one 
   virtual/work in an .SP file, it won't work.  Best to use the SP files 
   created with the GUI until I find a solution here in terms of GUI layout.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO DO
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[GENERAL]
 - Look at the PIP installer.
 - Update for wxPython3.0?
 - Setup a taskbar icon
 - Comment scanTab, ExtractTab, virtualsTab, guiFunctions
 - Find out how to store comments in the GUIpref.ini
 
[USERINDEX.INI]
 - Consider a tab to allow for generation of a userindex.ini file.
